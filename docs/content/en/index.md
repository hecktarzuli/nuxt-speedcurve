## What is SpeedCurve LUX?

LUX (which stands for Live User eXperience) gives you standard RUM (Real User Monitoring) metrics like page load time and start render. It also tracks metrics that give you a better sense of how fast your site feels to visitors such as number of critical blocking resources, images above the fold, and custom metrics.
